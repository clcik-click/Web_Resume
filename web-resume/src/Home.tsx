                      I’m a master’s student studying Applied Computer Science at Grand Valley State University. I’m working on my badges in Data Analytics, Database Management, Software Design and Development, and Web and Mobile. The naming might sound a bit distracting, but if I were to narrow down what I actually do, it would be software and database management and development — which is just something every computer science and software engineering student does anyway.

                      During my first year as a graduate student, I had the chance to work on several meaningful projects. For example, a project focused on databases:{" "}

                      On top of that, I’m currently working as an intern at Blue Nucleus, where we provide custom software development services to real-world industry clients. It’s been a great learning experience so far.

                          During engineering school, I started working at viastore (now a TOYOTA Automated Logistics Company) as an intern and eventually got hired full-time as a Controls Engineer. I spent close to five years there — and I enjoyed every bit of it.

                          At viastore, I specialized in commissioning, testing, and designing Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs). I’ve worked on various projects for customers like General Motors, Dollar General, Gordon Food Service, and Tyson Foods, just to name a few.

                          I’m someone who likes to try new ideas. I often find myself asking, “Why not?” — and that curiosity has led me to do a lot of unexpected things.

                          I’m glad I started playing soccer again with friends. I was horrible at it in school, but now it’s just fun. I tried pottery too — and now I know I’m not very good at it, but I enjoyed the process anyway. Same thing with rock climbing — turns out I need to train more, but I’m learning. I also started going to live performances. My first Broadway show was in New York City, and since then, I’ve been to many more. That extended into a love for symphonies and all kinds of performances. I just think they’re so cool.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Eventually, I got curious about nutrition because I wanted to feel better and perform better in my day-to-day life. That led me to become a certified nutrition coach. So far, I only have two clients — but I enjoy working with them and getting to know them deeply. One thing led to another, and that interest in nutrition turned into me working on my own little plot of garden (one of my clients/friends suggested the idea). Something I didn’t think I’d do until I owned a house (which, during this economy, would be quite a challenge). Still, I’m doing it now.
